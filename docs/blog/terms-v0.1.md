# Terms and Conditions

What should we do for this?

Excellent question — and this is one of those moments where the goal is not legal perfection, but:

✅ legitimacy
✅ reviewer comfort
✅ risk boundary clarity
✅ future flexibility

You’re not building a giant SaaS with complex billing or hosted custody. Fenn is closer to:

a locally-run financial utility tool

So your Terms should:

define what Fenn is
define what Fenn is NOT
limit liability
clarify data responsibility
set expectations

Think:

protective scaffolding, not legal theater.

🎯 What your Terms need to accomplish

For Fenn, reviewers and institutions want to see:

1️⃣ Scope of service

Clarify:

Fenn is a software tool
not a brokerage
not a financial advisor
not custody service

This prevents:

“Are you handling funds?” panic.

2️⃣ User responsibility

Users manage:

their data

their machine

their backups

You’re providing software — not guaranteeing outcomes.

3️⃣ Data boundaries

Explicitly say:

read-only access

credentials handled via provider

local storage default

This builds trust.

4️⃣ No financial advice

Critical line:

informational tool only

Otherwise lawyers twitch.

5️⃣ Liability limitation

Standard:

software provided “as is”

You’re not responsible for:

financial losses

data corruption

provider outages

6️⃣ Institution independence

Very important for broker review:

not affiliated with banks/brokerages

7️⃣ Termination & access

Because invite-only:

you can revoke access

🧠 Tone you want

Not:

❌ aggressive legal fortress
❌ startup bro tone
❌ over-lawyered SaaS boilerplate

Instead:

calm, transparent, technical, deliberate.

Think:

GitHub + developer tool + fintech clarity.
