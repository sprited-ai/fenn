# Fenn Frontend - v0.2

Let's iterate on copy:

**BEFORE**: 

> Fenn is a **command-line tool** that lets you securely download and organize your personal financial data across connected accounts.

This is a red flag for financial institutions. They will approve online tools that derive service-level value. This tool just provides a PORTAL into their data which they probably don't want to allow.

We need to be clear about "extra" value we provide.

**AFTER**:

> A financial tool that runs on your machine.

Immediate understanding.

Signals:

✔ local execution
✔ autonomy
✔ seriousness

No jargon.

## Revised Copies from Pixel

> Fenn

> A financial tool that runs on your machine.

> What is Fenn?
>
> Fenn lets you securely retrieve and organize your personal financial data across connected institutions — while keeping that data under your control.
> 
> Unlike traditional cloud dashboards, Fenn operates on your device. Portfolio data is stored and processed locally, allowing you to generate reports, analyze trends, and maintain your financial history without relying on a centralized service.
> 
> Fenn connects through secure provider authorization flows using read-only access. Banking credentials are never requested or stored by Fenn.
> 
> The guiding principle is simple:
> 
>> your financial data remains yours.

> How it works
>
> Fenn follows a device-managed workflow:
> 
> • Install Fenn on your computer
> • Link accounts through secure authorization providers
> • Sync financial data directly to your device
> • Generate reports and insights locally
> 
> Fenn services retain only the minimal metadata necessary for authentication and connection management. Financial records remain stored on your machine by default.

> Invite-only preview
>
> Fenn is currently in controlled preview as we refine security, reliability, and institutional integrations.
