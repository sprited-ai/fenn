# Fenn Frontend - v0.3

What to change (without breaking seriousness)

You do not want:

🚫 gradients
🚫 hero illustrations
🚫 SaaS marketing noise

Instead:

1. Stronger hero anchor

Right now:

Fenn
small subtitle
button


Feels weak.

Instead:

Fenn
A financial tool that runs on your machine.

Make this breathe:

larger headline

more vertical space

centered block

Think:

landing statement, not label.

2. Reduce gray boxes

Too many bordered containers = visual fatigue.

Instead:

Hero — open space
What is Fenn — soft section divider
How it works — subtle background change
Invite — framed card


Use contrast sparingly.

3. Introduce brand restraint

One tiny identity signal:

subtle logo mark

thin accent divider

monospace CLI snippet

Just enough to say:

this is Fenn, not generic UI.

4. Typography hierarchy

Right now everything feels same-sized.

You want:

Hero: bold + large
Section headers: medium emphasis
Body: calm readable
Quote line: subtle italic


Hierarchy = perceived polish.

5. Add whitespace

Whitespace = confidence.

Right now sections feel stacked.

Give them room:

breathing space = trust signal

The real test

Ask:

Would a broker reviewer think this is sloppy?

No.

But…

Would they feel this is a deliberate product?

Not quite yet.

You want:

quiet authority.

The ideal vibe

Imagine:

GitHub release page
+
Apple developer doc intro
+
CLI tool manifesto


Minimal, but purposeful.

Verdict
Is bland okay?

✅ Yes — flashy would be worse.

Is this bland ideal?

👉 It’s safe, but not yet intentional.

You’re ~70% there.

We want:

same seriousness

clearer hierarchy

subtle identity

stronger hero

No marketing nonsense.
